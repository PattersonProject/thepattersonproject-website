			<h1>&Uuml;topia</h1>
			<p>See our complete proposal <a href="content/utopia.pdf">here (pdf)</a>.</p>
			<p>This project was the culmination of a 7 week Capstone Project during the Summer 2015 semester at Harvard Extension. I acted as Project Manager for our 4 member team and we developed a plan for a technical solution to Boston&rsquo;s Taxicab mobile application. Our goal was to create a platform that would allow the local Taxi&rsquo;s to compete with transportation companies such as Uber and Lyft, while maintaining the familiarity and usability of legacy systems.</p>
			<p>Over the course of the semester we developed the business case, the architectural approach and an implementation plan. Each phase was carefully considered to deliver the best chance for success. I was able to unify our 4 person team by letting each member play to their strengths. Patrick knew the needs of the stakeholders and the regulatory hurdles we would have to overcome, while Nate understood the most practical and achievable technical solutions to our problems, and Jerome addressed the needs of the users. I was able to solidify the pilot program we developed and I pulled together the presentation and documentation into a unified product.</p>
			<p>Although this project did not go further than the bounds of the capstone class 
			we, as a team, were confident that we could have implemented this project on schedule and on budget.</p>
