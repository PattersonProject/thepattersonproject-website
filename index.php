			I am a skilled team builder who gets results. As an experienced project manager I stay focused on the goals of stakeholders while tracking down the tiniest details that might threaten success. Now I am adding web design and development to my skill set by completing my MLA in Information Systems Management this spring at Harvard Extension. I look forward to combining years of experience marshaling resources for live theatrical productions with my newly acquired skills in front end development to create experiences that users want and stakeholders need. As a strategic thinker I can work both as a team member and a leader letting the big picture inform how I go about problem solving.
